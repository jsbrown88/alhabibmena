The file "backend/logs/access.log" is a log file, not a code file. It's used to store logs of access events in the application. It's typically populated by a logging library or middleware like morgan in Node.js. 

However, as per your request, here's an example of what entries in this file might look like:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Dec/2021:10:15:20 +0000] "GET /api/documents HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Dec/2021:10:16:25 +0000] "POST /api/documents HTTP/1.1" 201 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Dec/2021:10:17:30 +0000] "GET /api/documents/123 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Dec/2021:10:18:35 +0000] "PUT /api/documents/123 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Dec/2021:10:19:40 +0000] "DELETE /api/documents/123 HTTP/1.1" 204 -
```

Each line represents an HTTP request made to the application, including the client IP address, date and time of the request, HTTP method, request path, HTTP version, and the status code of the response.
