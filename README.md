The application we are developing is designed to bridge the communication gap between dental professionals and patients. It utilizes a web-based interface where dentists can upload a PDF or DOCX containing their technical analysis and treatment planning annotations. These often complex remarks are then processed through PINECONE Vector DB and interpreted by OPENAI's GPT-4 model, translating the technical jargon into a clear and structured explanation. Presented with a minimalistic design, the application aims to demystify dental treatments for patients, making the information more accessible and comprehensible. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, our goal is to foster better understanding and collaboration between dentists and patients in their treatment planning process.
In aligning our dental interpretation application with the hospital's existing IT infrastructure, we need to focus on seamless integration through RESTful APIs. This involves adhering to the hospital's IT policies, security protocols, and developing APIs that align with standard HTTP methods and the hospital's data structures. Your tasks will include mapping and transforming data, ensuring compliance with encryption and authentication standards, creating comprehensive API documentation, and rigorous testing with the hospital's IT team. Scalability, monitoring, and robust access control are also essential. Your collaboration with the hospital's IT personnel will be vital to understanding specific needs and constraints, ensuring our application's smooth functionality within the existing environment.

Architecture Overview

1. Framework: React 
2. Design: Minimalistic approach with a white background, clear lines defining different sections, and a placeholder for a logo on the top right.
3. Functionalities: Document upload button, display section for GPT-4 output.
Backend:
1. Framework: Express.js running on Node.js.
2. Database: PINECONE Vector DB to store dental analysis documents.
3. Integration: OPENAI's GPT-4 API for processing and translating dental remarks.
Communication:
1. RESTful APIs: For interaction between frontend and backend.
2. PINECONE API: For handling Vector DB.
3. OPENAI API: For natural language processing.

Detailed Requirements
Frontend:
Document Upload Section:
1. Place a button (not in the header) at the top of the page for dentists to upload the PDF or DOCX document.
2. Provide a preview of the uploaded document.
3. Add validation to ensure that the uploaded file is a PDF or DOCX.
Output Display Section:
1. Display the structured explanation (from GPT-4) of the annotated PDF or DOCX.
2. Ensure proper formatting for readability.
Design Elements:
1. Minimalistic design with white background.
2. Define different sections with clear lines.
3. Add a placeholder for the logo on the top right.
Backend:
Document Processing: 
1. Receive the uploaded PDF or DOCX from the frontend.
Text Extraction:
1. Implement text extraction from PDF files using the pdf-parse library.
2. Implement text extraction from DOCX files using the mammoth.js library.
3. Ensure that the extracted text is clean and free from unnecessary formatting or characters.
Text Vectorization:
1. Convert the extracted text into a numerical vector using the TF-IDF method.
2. Consider using existing libraries or services that provide TF-IDF functionality.
3. Ensure that the vectorization captures the essential features of the text to represent the document effectively.
Save to Pinecone:
1. Save the generated vector to Pinecone, ensuring that it's properly structured and conforms to the requirements of the Pinecone API.
Process and store it into PINECONE Vector DB.
Integration with OPENAI GPT-4:
1. Fetch the document's vector from PINECONE.
2. Construct a predefined prompt + context.
3. Send it to OPENAI GPT-4 API.
4. Receive and send the processed data to the frontend.
Error Handling:
1. Proper error handling for failed uploads, API failures, etc.
User Stories
1. As a Dentist: I want to upload a PDF or DOCX document easily, so that it can be processed quickly.
2. As a Dentist: I want to see a preview of the uploaded document, to confirm the correct file.
3. As a Patient: I want to see a clear and understandable explanation of the dental analysis, so that I can grasp my treatment planning.
4. As an Admin: I want the application to have a clean and minimalistic design, so that it is easy to navigate.
5. As an Admin: I want the integration between PINECONE and OPENAI to be seamless, so that the processing is smooth and accurate.

Integration Requirements:
Develop a set of RESTful APIs that can be consumed by the hospital's existing systems.
1. Ensure that the APIs support standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE as needed.
2. Use standard conventions for endpoints, status codes, and error messages.
API Documentation and Testing:
1. Provide comprehensive API documentation including endpoints, request/response examples, and error handling.
2. Perform rigorous testing of APIs with the hospital's IT team to ensure proper functionality, reliability, and performance.
Monitoring and Support:
1. Implement robust logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to track API usage, performance, and potential issues.
2. Provide ongoing support to the hospital's IT team for troubleshooting and updates.
Scalability Considerations:
1. Design the APIs and underlying architecture to support the potential scale of hospital usage, considering concurrent users, request rates, and data volume.
Access Control and Security:
1. Implement role-based access control to ensure only authorized systems and personnel can access the APIs.
2. Apply security best practices such as HTTPS, OAuth, or other authentication/authorization mechanisms in accordance with the hospital's security policies.
